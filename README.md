# Together Culture Database System

This repository contains the full design and implementation of a relational database system developed for **Together Culture**, a community-led organization in Cambridge that supports creative and entrepreneurial growth.
The project provides a structured and scalable data solution to help the organization manage its operations and community engagement efficiently.

---

## Project Overview

The database was designed to help Together Culture:

* Manage memberships and workspace bookings.
* Track events, attendance, and user engagement.
* Support marketing campaigns and prospective member data through MailChimp integration.
* Analyse space usage, participation, and engagement patterns to improve decision-making.

The repository documents the entire process — from requirement analysis and data modelling to database implementation and SQL evaluation.
